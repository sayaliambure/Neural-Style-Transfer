# Neural-Style-Transfer

Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image, and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image.

This project is done using Pytorch, CNN, using a pretrainied vgg model
